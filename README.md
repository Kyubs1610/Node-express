# Node-express

- Get back to your previous code and install express
- Create a POST `/user` route, to add a new user to your table
- Create a GET `/users` route, to get the list of all users
- Create a GET `/user/:id` route, to get a single user
- Create a PATCH `/user/:id` route, to edit an user

I'm using POSTMAN in order to test POST & PATCH don't forget to set Content-Type on raw & JSON
